## Usage

**Remember to request permission `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` in AndroidManifest.xml and Runtime.**

```kotlin
GalleryEngine.Builder()
    .choose(MimeType.ALL)       // Media type to select: ALL/IMAGE/VIDEO, default = MimeType.ALL
    .multiple(true)             // support multiple selection, default = false
    .maxSelect(5)               // max number of selection, support in multiple selection mode only
    .imageMaxSize(1024)         // max image file size in KB, support image mode only
    .videoMaxSecond(60)         // max video duration in second, support video mode only
    .videoMinSecond(3)          // min video duration in second, support video mode only
    .forResult(this, REQUEST_SELECT_MEDIA)  // start gallery and specify the request code

```

## Get Selected Media
In `Activity` or `Fragment`, to override `onActivityResult()` and pass `data: Intent?` to `GalleryEngine.getSelectMediaPaths(data)` to get the selected media path list:

```kotlin
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    if (requestCode == REQUEST_SELECT_MEDIA && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        Toast.makeText(this, GalleryEngine.getSelectMediaPaths(data).toString(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```
